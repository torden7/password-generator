# password-generator
A password generator creating passwords with random characters

- The generator can create passwords with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols (?, #, !, &, etc.).
- The program randomly picks an available character type and then randomly picks a character of this type (each type is almost always picked at least once).
-	The user can create passwords with certain character types and exclude uppercase letters, digits, or symbols.
-	If the user excludes some character type, the generator offers to add it to make the passwords safer or to refuse and continue.
-	The user can create a certain amount of passwords and choose their length.
-	If the password length is shorter than 12 symbols, the user can enter a larger length to make the passwords safer or leave the length as it is.
-	When the passwords are generated, the program offers to generate new ones.
